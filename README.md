## Overview
**Log Analyzer** is a Python tool that scans system logs to detect **failed login attempts**, **brute-force attacks**, and other suspicious activity. It simulates a **mini SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tool** and is perfect for cybersecurity learning, SOC labs, and incident response training.

---

## Features
- Detect multiple failed login attempts from a single IP
- Identify potential brute-force attacks
- Count failed attempts per IP and generate reports
- Create **visual charts** showing top attackers and failed attempts
- Export analysis results to **CSV** for further review
- Lightweight CLI interface

---

## How It Works
1. Input a log file (e.g., `auth.log`, `syslog`, or custom logs)  
2. Scan each line for **failed login attempts**  
3. Extract IP addresses using **regex**  
4. Count failed attempts per IP  
5. Flag IPs with more than a threshold (e.g., 5) as suspicious  
6. Generate **summary report** and optional **charts** for visualization

## Sample Output

```
Top 5 IPs with failed login attempts:
192.168.1.15 - 12 attempts
10.0.0.5    - 8 attempts
172.16.0.9  - 6 attempts
...
```
